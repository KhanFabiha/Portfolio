				<h2>My Work Experience</h2>
				<p>With an aspiration to build a dynamic career spanning several industries, I have cultivated a diverse skill set. Below is a brief overview of my professional experience:</p>

				  <div class="card bg-dark border border-primary-subtle rounded-3" style="color: rgb(246, 237, 220);">
					<div class="card-body">
					  <h3 class="card-title">Internship Experience UK (IEUK) at Bright Network</h3>
					  <p class="card-text">
						<p>My recent internship at Bright Network in the technology stream presented an incredible opportunity to experience the real-world dynamics of a professional environment while applying my academic knowledge to tangible challenges. The highlight of this experience was participating in a project aimed at revamping the customer engagement strategy for a company facing a decline in its customer base.</p>
						<p>This real-world challenge required us to step into the shoes of the company’s stakeholders and analyse the problem from various angles. Working in a tech stream, I was presented with the task of designing a comprehensive road map to help the company improve its customer acquisition and retention strategies. I was tasked with not just identifying the problems but also brainstorming actionable solutions that could be implemented effectively.</p>
						<p>The first step in my project was conducting thorough research on the factors contributing to the decline in customers. This involved analysing current market trends, competitor strategies, and customer preferences. Once I had a clear understanding of the issues at hand, I set out to design a detailed timeline that outlined specific tasks to enhance the customer experience and outreach.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Through this experience, I achieved several key milestones that contributed to my personal and professional growth, and solidified my understanding of real-world applications of technology in business. Some of my achievements included:</p>
						<p> * Strategic Thinking: I learned to approach problems analytically, considering multiple perspectives and potential outcomes while designing the roadmap.</p>
						<p> * Industry Exposure: Gaining exposure to the latest technologies and industry trends expanded my understanding of the tech landscape and how businesses adapt to changes.</p>
						<p> * Real-World Impact: Knowing that my contributions could potentially influence the company's trajectory instilled a sense of purpose and responsibility in my work.</p>

					  <h3 class="card-title">Content writer/Copy editor at Nurit (Software Development Company)</h3>
					  <p class="card-text">
						<p>My role as a content writer for Nurit, a software development company, allowed me to turn intricate technical jargon into clear and accessible content for their website. This experience not only honed my writing skills but also deepened my understanding of the software development landscape.</p>
						<p>My primary goal as a content writer was to articulate nurit's mission in a way that resonates with potential clients, ensuring they grasp what nurit do and how nurit's services can benefit them. One of the biggest challenges in writing for a technology-focused audience is breaking down complicated ideas into easily digestible content. Software development encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including programming languages, project management methodologies, and user interface design. My approach was to use simple and easy-to-understand language, steering clear of technical jargon unless absolutely necessary.</p>
						<p>For instance, rather than using terms like "agile methodology" or "object-oriented programming," I focused on describing what these concepts mean for the client. I explained how agile development allows for flexibility in projects, enabling quicker adjustments based on feedback. Similarly, I highlighted how user interface design plays a crucial role in creating a pleasant experience for customers. Last but not least, I believe that effective content is more than just words on a page; it is a bridge connecting potential clients to the solutions they seek.</p> 
						<p>Looking back, being part of the early version of this website was an invaluable experience. It taught me about collaboration, scheduling, and the importance of perseverance. Today, as that website continues to grow and evolve, I take immense pride in knowing that I contributed to its foundational stages.</p>
						<br>
						<p> My key achievements included:</p>
						<p> * Content Strategy Development: I played a pivotal role in establishing a coherent content strategy that aligns with Nurit’s mission and goals.</p>
						<p> * Website Revamp: I collaborated closely with developers. My contributions helped create a streamlined user experience for the clients.</p>
						<p> * Audience Understanding: Knowing who you are writing for is crucial. By focusing on the needs and questions of our target audience, I was able to create content that truly resonated, making complex concepts more relatable and engaging.</p>
